# Table1

A project that I made for my university lecture. It contains such functionalities as (operated on the table):
- loading data from a text file
- saving data to a text file
- loading data from the database
- loading data from XML file
- saving data to XML file
- loading data about the manufacturer's founder and the date of establishment from a locally placed server containing data from a JSON file

```bash
